          <h3>programming</h3>
          <p class="p-prgramming"> companies face all the time problems with professional IT employees who work in tech part of the company and managers who see have a business background
            and have no background of IT. So they dont know how to make a connection and increase efficiency of their companies.Thats when need of having experts
            information systems in comopanies appears.
            As a student of Information system I know how to deal with this one but unfortunately have no experience in big companies.I know python, SQL, Javascript, html, css and I would like to work in big companies as a data scientist or business application developer
            I have learned the fundamentals of programming and coding and have already used my knowledge in small projects that I have had in my courses
            such as small apps and projects but I prefer to put them in practice by working in big companies who allways have dream of getting bigger better
            and stronger. </p>
